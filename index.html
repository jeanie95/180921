    <h6>My name is Jiin Suh and I am a student at University of Michigan, studying passionately in UI/UX design in both School of Art and Design and School of Information. I am also a minor in Art History. </h6>

<h6>I have worked as a graphic designer at Amore Pacific, a cosmetics company, and Korean Institution of Technology and Science Information. I can comfortably use Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Xd, and Final Cut Pro X. With these programs, I have previously developed prototypes of mobile apps, designed brands and posters for classes. </h6>
